# Introduction to SQL

> SQL (pronounced "ess-que-el") stands for Structured Query Language. SQL is used
> to communicate with a database. According to ANSI (American National Standards
> Institute), it is the standard language for relational database management
> systems. SQL statements are used to perform tasks such as update data on a
> database, or retrieve data from a database. Some common relational database
> management systems that use SQL are: Oracle, Sybase, Microsoft SQL Server,
> Access, Ingres, etc. Although most database systems use SQL, most of them also
> have their own additional proprietary extensions that are usually only used on
> their system. However, the standard SQL commands such as "Select", "Insert",
> "Update", "Delete", "Create", and "Drop" can be used to accomplish almost
> everything that one needs to do with a database...
